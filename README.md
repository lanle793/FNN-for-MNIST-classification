# FNN-for-MNIST-classification
Feedforward Neural Network for MNIST handwritten digit image classification

Instructions on how to run the code:

1. (Setup) Install Tensorflow and Keras as these are the framework and library used to build the model
2. Put the "data" folder and FNN.ipynb file in the same directory (folder)
3. Open FNN.ipynb with Jupyter notebook and hit Run
4. After the training is done, a loss vs iteration plot should show up.
